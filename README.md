Practice
========

### These practice exercises are provided to you to prepare for cs514 over the summer.

In this set of practice problems, you will practice using the following:

- Math operations
- Methods
- Conditionals
- Iteration
- Arrays
- Strings
- Github

The skeleton code for these problems is at the following link: https://github.com/USF-CS514-Fall18/practice/tree/master/src/main
(see instructions below on getting started).

### Overview

The goal of this set of practice problems is to help you prepare for CS 514. It is a fast paced class, and incoming students are expected to know the basics of programming such as methods, loops, conditionals, and arrays. If you find yourself struggling with these problems then you should consider completing an online Java course or carefully going through an introductory Java textbook *and* completing the programming exercises.

Though there may be partial or complete solutions to some of these questions on various sites like StackOverflow, it is expected that you solve these problems *without* using the Internet as a resource. 

### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have set up your [development environment](https://github.com/USF-CS514-Fall18/devEnvironment.md). You'll need to decide how you want to access github -- using command line tools, IntelliJ, or the Github Desktop tool.
2. Use the following link to create your private github repository for this assignment. 
The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code. Clone a copy to your local machine.
3. Complete all of the methods specified in each class. 
4. Submit your solution to the private github repo (if you want the intructor to take a look at your solutions).

### Practice Questions

This practice assignment contains the following classes: `ConversionsHelper`, `MathHelper`, `ArrayHelper`, and `StringHelper`. 
To complete this practice assignment, complete each class as specified in the comments above each method and the `//TODO` notes in each class. 


### Hints

It is recommended you complete the classes in the order specified above:

1. `ConversionHelper`
2. `MathHelper`
3. `ArrayHelper`
4. `StringHelper`
