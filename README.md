Practice
========

### These practice exercises are provided to you to prepare for cs514 over the summer.

In this set of practice problems, you will practice using the following:

- Math operations
- Methods
- Conditionals
- Iteration
- Arrays
- Strings
- Github

### Overview

The goal of this set of practice problems is to help you prepare for CS 514.

By the second week of the semester you will need to have mastered all of the concepts covered by these practice problems. This includes the Java syntax, the submission procedure, and the problem solving required for the more complex solutions. If you find yourself struggling with these problems then you should consider completing an online Java course or carefully going through an introductory Java textbook *and* completing the programming exercises required.

:warning: **You should be able to complete all of these problems with little to no help from the Internet.**

Though there may be partial or complete solutions to some of these questions on various sites like StackOverflow, it is expected that you solve these problems *without* using the Internet as a resource. 

### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have set up your [development environment](https://github.com/USF-CS514-Fall18/devEnvironment.md). You'll need to decide how you want to access github -- using command line tools, IntelliJ, or the Github Desktop tool.
2. Use the following link to create your private github repository for this assignment. 
The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code. Clone a copy to your local machine.
3. Complete all of the methods specified in each class. 
4. Submit your solution to the private github repo (if you want the intructor to take a look at your solutions).

### Practice Questions

This practice assignment contains the following classes: `ConversionsHelper`, `MathHelper`, `ArrayHelper`, and `StringHelper`. 
To complete this practice assignment, complete each class as specified in the comments above each method and the `//TODO` notes in each class. 


### Hints

It is recommended you complete the classes in the order specified above:

1. `ConversionHelper`
2. `MathHelper`
3. `ArrayHelper`
4. `StringHelper`
